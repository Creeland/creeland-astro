The book paints a deliberately heavy-handed, vivid picture of a dystopian world where Big Brother and the Party maintain complete control over every aspect of the citizens' lives, including their love lives and personal relationships.

I thought it was interesting how Orwell even showed the dark side of sexual oppression and how that can be used as a tool.

A lot of people think 1984 is just about communism. It's true that this book was written at beginning of the Cold War, but Orwell had more nuance than that. He fought in the Spanish Civil War against the fascists and was a self-described democratic-socialist. The book is really a warning against any kind of totalitarian regime or power that seeks to control its citizens through fear, manipulation, and oppression.

The ending of the book is interesting because he doesn't give a glimmer of hope. I feel that it was a warning. That eventually, if things got to the point of what was shown in the book, there wouldn't be any hope of fighting it anymore. So you have to do everything in your power to prevent things from getting to that point.

But what can I even do? I don't know.

It gives you a lot to think about. It's a great book.
